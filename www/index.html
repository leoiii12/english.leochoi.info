                <h2>English Is Important!</h2>
                <p>For making easier money? Getting rich? Or for a high rank position to be a big Tycoon? Actually, this is up to you. Whatever you want to be, you have to master English because it is a type of international languages.</p>
                <p>For society, Hong Kong is an internaltional city. People set forth to learn English, speak them, write with them and listen to them for the purpose of getting Hong Kong more powerful to compete with the rivals from the mother tongue countries.</p>
                <p>During my summer holiday, I was working in a company which is extremely globalised. I was suprised because there are no Chinese documents or a word written in Chinese! So I found the necessity of learning English. I think you are willing to embark on your life with an international company to get high income and become sucessful.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>Oh! What are the rationales for failing English?</h4>
                <p>The reasons are threefold. First, I didn't plan an effective timetable for English. Second, I am lazy. Third, I am too shy to use it.</p>
                <p>Now, I know the only to master english that is sparing no effort. You have to everyday read English newspapers, listen to English songs and interact with your friends in English. If you can do so, you will master English. Take studying Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) as an example, I got 5* in ICT without "revision" last year. It isn't because I am genius but deligent. Not opening the reference books and reading it, I learnt ICT through reading computer news everyday, studying programming and building this website with my knowledge that is a type of hard work.</p>
                <p>The only way to master English is to use it, isn't it?</p>

                <h4>Will I give up?</h4>
                <p>I have no offer last year not because I did not get enough marks. In my opinion, it is quite high, 25. I remembered there is only 20% people who can get this result. The reason is I failed English Language in DSE! I got 2...</p>
                <p>Since I cannot tolerate myself getting such low marks in English, I must enter the university!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Timetable</h4>
                <p>Reading would be a wonderful idea. I will read English newspaper everyday on the Internet. No one can deny the hard fact that CNN is my best choice to learn British English. CNN provides the most comprehensive news in the world and it is a historic and great organization.</p>
                <p>I am reading Life of Pi now.</p>
                <p>I will also listen to some English songs.</p>
