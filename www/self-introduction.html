                <h2>Name, Dream, Faith</h2>
                <p>My name is Choi Man Kin. You can call me Choi Gain. My sister and my brother has named this. I love working with computer, for example, editing photos and videos, developing games, designing webpage and programming.</p>
                <p>My dream is to study Computer Engineering. I want to study more knowledge about computer and engineering.</p>
                <p>Since my childhood, I have fallen in love with computer. I have read many books about it. I am not only a basic user, but also an advanced programmer. I have also read many books such as programming, 3D multimedia and web page design. I enjoy working with computer but I am sorrowful now that I do not have enough time to read computer books. I have to prepare the HKDSE.</p>
                <p>My faith in life is “Walk the walk instead of talk the talk”. I have applied it to my post of Student Union, Chess Club and Computer Club. Moreover, I have been keen on Mathematics, Physics and Computer literacy. They are my strongest subjects.</p>

                <h2>School Life</h2>
                <p>I participated in the student union of my school. I was invited by the chairperson because he thought that I am diligent and good at computer. Being a committee member, I have completed many computer projects for students. I frequently put forward my opinions for the activities since I want to optimize every activity for students.</p>
                <p>During the Teacher’s Day, I took the most challenging post in the drama. The drama is also the most challenging activity for the whole team. Our team had to consider every detail to modify. I was appointed to be the multimedia controller for the stage. If I have done badly, everything would have failed. I need to control special effect, music, microphones and computer. I asked why I was given those extremely important jobs. They just said “we only trust you to complete this mission”.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the play have been performed perfectly. I rejoice that I have this good chance to learn. In fact, I have learnt a lot, for example, being confident. This is the most important thing. If I did not trust myself, I would not have finished this mission perfectly. From my experience, teamwork is important which was revealed by my work in student union. Personal ability is important but communication skill is more important. I want to thank my student union team members for encouraging me. They told me that I need to put forward my opinions.</p>
                <h2>Silence</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, I enjoy working quietly, because I can do everything faster and more accurately. It is the origin of my proverb.</p>
